# SimpleBookService

I have created a book service as per the requirements in the document.

For the API I used an ASP.NET application in .Net Framework 4.8.
I created a "library.json" file to store the books created in the Data folder of the solution.


For the frontend I created a basic enough Angular application.
I only thought of this after I created the Angular app, but there may be some pacakages that need to be downloaded to get it running.
There is also a variable *ApiEndpoint* in the services/book-service.ts. This needs to be replaced with the endpoint you are running the API from.
